This project is a simple yet powerful demonstration of how real-time object detection can be combined with an intelligent decision-making agent inspired by Reinforcement Learning (RL) principles. It leverages the pretrained YOLOv5s model from Ultralytics to detect objects from a webcam feed and applies a basic logic system to determine how to react to each detection based on its confidence level.

üéØ Key Features
Live Webcam Feed: Captures real-time video using OpenCV.

Object Detection: Utilizes the lightweight yolov5s model for fast and efficient object recognition.

RL-Inspired Decision Agent: Applies logic based on detection confidence to simulate intelligent behavior.

Real-Time Visualization: Annotates the video feed with bounding boxes, object labels, and the current agent action.

üß∞ Tech Stack
Python

PyTorch

OpenCV

YOLOv5 (via PyTorch Hub)

üîç How It Works
Model Initialization:
The script loads the YOLOv5s model from the Ultralytics repository using torch.hub. This model is pretrained on the COCO dataset and can detect 80 common object classes.

*****
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s', pretrained=True)
model.eval()
*****

Reinforcement Learning-Inspired Agent:
A simple function named rl_agent_action() interprets the detection results. It selects the top-most object (the one with the highest confidence) and decides what action to take:

If confidence > 0.6 ‚Üí Track the object.

If confidence > 0.4 ‚Üí Observe the object.

If confidence ‚â§ 0.4 ‚Üí Ignore the object.

If no objects are detected ‚Üí Search the environment.

This logic mimics a basic decision-making mechanism often found in RL environments, where agents respond differently based on the certainty of observations.

Webcam Stream and Detection Loop:
Inside the run_webcam() function:

The webcam is opened using OpenCV.

Each video frame is passed to the YOLOv5 model for detection.

The agent evaluates the results and chooses an action.

The annotated frame is rendered, including bounding boxes and the current action.

The loop continues until the user presses 'q'.

def run_webcam():

User Feedback and Visualization:
The live video stream displays both:

Object detection results (class label, bounding boxes).

The RL agent's current decision rendered on the screen.

üí° Example Use Cases
Educational demos for understanding AI behavior.

Smart surveillance systems that react based on object detection certainty.

Robotics projects where robots make decisions based on sensor input.

Prototyping AI assistants or interactive agents in real-world environments.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project
Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+

PyTorch (with CUDA if you want GPU acceleration)

OpenCV

Internet access (to download YOLOv5 from torch.hub)

Steps:
Clone the repository or copy the script to your local machine.

Install dependencies:

******
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python pandas
Run the script:
******

python your_script_name.py
A window will open showing the live webcam feed with detection overlays. Press 'q' to quit.

üìå Notes
This is a simplified RL simulation, not a full reinforcement learning implementation.

Performance may vary depending on your webcam and system specifications.

For better accuracy or additional features, consider using larger YOLO models (yolov5m, yolov5l, etc.) or adding real RL algorithms.
